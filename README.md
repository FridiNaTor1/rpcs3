This is the patChed version of RPCS3
=====
The patChed version just makes it possible to connect to a custom LBP server
=====

I use Cirrus CI to automatically compile any new build from this fork. Just go to release and click the link to download the new version for the OS you use.

This is based on the patch jvyden made, this is only a hack that ignores the error of raw-sockets, this allows you to stay connected to LBP servers while the feature is not implemented. Multiplayer does not work, but any other feature like playing online levels, earning thropies and pins, and uploading levels should work.
